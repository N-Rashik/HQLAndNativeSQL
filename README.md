**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an Employee entity using Hibernate.
It has two versions:
HQLDemo.java – Uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL).
NativeSQLDemo.java – Uses native SQL queries.

**Features**

Add a new employee (CREATE)
View employee by ID (READ)
Update employee email (UPDATE)
Delete employee by ID (DELETE)
View all employees (READ ALL)
Exit the program (EXIT)

**Difference Between HQL & Native SQL**

| Feature     | HQL                  | Native SQL                |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Query       | Uses entity names    | Uses table names          |
| Example     | `from Employee`      | `SELECT * FROM employee1` |
| Portability | Database-independent | Database-specific         |
