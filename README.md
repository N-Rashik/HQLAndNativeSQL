**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an Employee entity using Hibernate.

**It has two versions:**

1. HQLDemo.java – Uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL).
2. NativeSQLDemo.java – Uses native SQL queries.

**Features**

1. Add a new employee (CREATE)
2. View employee by ID (READ)
3. Update employee email (UPDATE)
4. Delete employee by ID (DELETE)
5. View all employees (READ ALL)
6. Exit the program (EXIT)

**Difference Between HQL & Native SQL**

| Feature     | HQL                  | Native SQL                |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Query       | Uses entity names    | Uses table names          |
| Example     | from Employee      | SELECT * FROM employee1 |
| Portability | Database-independent | Database-specific         |
